I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2013 and 2015. Given my interest in optimization, I found it optimal to pursue my education at one of the best engineering schools in the world: UC Berkeley.

I received my second M.Sc. from UC Berkeley in 2016, and I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, which is expected to be granted in 2020. 

Optimization is my expertise and I use it every second to feed myself with the best quality and restricted budget, to get somewhere in the fastest way, to get the highest score in exams with the least effort, and ultimately, to have the maximum joy with regards to all difficulties.
